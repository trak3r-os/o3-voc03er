# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- CHORDS pads, one rule for every row (issue #4): the bottom row plays F6's kind and each row above plays the next kind in the order
  TRIAD, 7TH, OPEN, POWER, round. F6 TRIAD, the default, keeps the grid as it was; F6 7TH, OPEN or POWER no longer play one kind on two
  rows. With BEND ROW on, the three chord rows play F6's kind and the next two. PERFORM's HELP names each row's kind.
- PATTERN's NOTE palette follows the same rule: F6's kind on the lower row, the next kind above it. The pad labels name the kind.

### Added

- PATTERN: SHIFT + a chord pad on the NOTE lane writes its root alone, a single note (issue #2). A single-note step lights its column in
  both palette rows. With PADS on KEYS the palette is single notes already.

### Fixed

- PATTERN: a step pad past LENGTH no longer moves the cursor off the pattern.

## v0.2.0 (pre-release)

A sound release: TALK is reworked to behave like a talkbox, and BANDS is darker. It is a pre-release and needs more testing.

### Changed

- TALK as a talkbox (`docs/ENGINE-REALISM.md`, "TALK as a talkbox"):
  - On consonants the carrier ducks (down to -26 dB) and the voice's own air, low-passed, comes through instead, as when the
    mouth closes on a real tube. Vowels keep the carrier; a level gate keeps the breath shut in the pauses.
  - The carrier's top is rolled off (a one-pole at 3.5 kHz, a smaller first difference), like a driver and a tube.
  - A damped comb on the carrier, as a 0.9 m tube between the driver and the mouth.
  - A gentle 2:1 compressor on TALK's output (5 ms attack, 120 ms release).
  - A microphone's proximity lift (+3 dB below 200 Hz) and the carrier's leak from the box at -32 dB, heard even with the mouth shut.
- BANDS: less noise injected in the top bands on consonants, and a one-pole low-pass after the bands, so the sum is less bright.
  THRU and DRY are not dulled by it.
- Every new value is a starting point for the ear. Measured on the host against a read voice and five dry/processed vocoder pairs
  (measurements only; no audio is in the repository).

### Fixed

- `app_test` passes again: the presentation video's scenarios moved to `tools/video/scenarios/`.
- The CHANGELOG's CPU line for v0.1.0 now gives the silent readings.

### Added

- A GitHub Actions workflow that runs `tools/ci.sh host` and `mk66` only when a release tag is pushed, against the o3-sdk commit in
  `tools/o3sdk.ref`.
- `tools/video/`: the scripts that rebuild the presentation video from the simulator.

### What a unit has shown

Read on a unit on the release candidate (`v0.1.0-17-g2de46c7`, the same code as the tag), each row a silent read (`cpu reset`, 60 s with
nothing sent, one `cpu` read); the render's limit is 180,240 cycles at the peak (69 % of the block):

- BANDS, eight notes: peak 143,521 (54.9 %); with four loops playing: 170,596 (65.3 %, as in v0.1.0).
- TALK at Quality 16, a held chord: 132,863 (50.8 %); at Quality 24: 143,499 (54.9 %); at Quality 24 with four loops playing:
  173,741 (66.5 %, about 7k over v0.1.0's 166,762, inside the limit).
- ROBOT, a held chord: 144,404 (55.2 %).
- No underrun, mute, late block, hardware fault or shed in any row; no crash record.

Not tried on a unit: how the new TALK and BANDS sound (the values are starting points for the ear), DIN MIDI, an outside hardware
sequencer. The app still swaps `system.o3s` and its `.bak` on the card at boot (known since v0.1.0).

## v0.1.0 (pre-release)

The first public release. It is a pre-release and needs more testing.

### What it does

- Four modes: BANDS (a 16-band channel vocoder), TALK (an LPC talkbox), TUNE (pitch correction to a key and scale) and ROBOT (the bands
  with a fast compressor).
- Sources: the line input, the microphone, USB audio, the radio, and samples on either side of the vocoder.
- An internal carrier synth of eight voices (SHAPE, SPREAD, SUB, TILT, NOISE), played from chord pads: twelve roots, triad, seventh, open
  and power rows, four voicings (CLOSE, OPEN, WIDE, SMOOTH), a KEYS mode and a bend row. The SHIFT row holds FREEZE, GATE, ARP, GLIDE,
  FORMANT, THRU, BEND ROW and PRESET.
- Four sample slots of 16 s, with up to 24 slices each, edited on the unit (trim, speed, direction, slices).
- A step sequencer: eight patterns (A to H) of 1 to 16 steps with NOTE, CARRIER, LEVEL and SLICE lanes, and a SONG of up to 16 rows
  with repeats.
- MIDI in: notes, pitch bend, mod wheel vibrato, program change (picks the pattern), notes from 36 that fire slices, MIDI learn and a
  clock to follow.
- Projects saved to the card as `project.o3a` under `Apps/o3_voc03er/`, with the sample slots as WAVs.

### What a unit has shown

Read on a unit during development (`docs/PLAN.md`, sections 4 to 4l):

- The render's CPU stays under its limit on the readings taken, with BANDS, eight carrier notes and four loops running (about 62 to 67 % of
  the block at the worst peak on the last readings), with no underrun and no shed in any of them. TALK at order 16 is inside the budget by
  its mean.
- A project round trip works: speed, direction, level and trim of a slot come back after a save and a load, and the other slots stay as
  they were. Saving the WAVs takes about 2 s a slot, and so does loading.
- MIDI over USB works.

### Needs more testing

- The sound is judged by ear on the unit, and that listening is still owed for most of it: the glides, the gate edges, the vibrato, the
  presets' levels, the carrier's tone, the formant steps and the clicks at the source switch. A spoken sentence has to be checked for how
  well it can be understood, and the microphone source has had little use.
- The radio's signal was not measured on a known station. Line and radio were reported as working by the maintainer, not by a reading.
- The CPU rows were read in silence (nothing sent to the console during the window, which was found to add about 10k cycles to the peak)
  for BANDS only. TALK, TUNE and QUALITY 24 were last read with console traffic, inside the limit by their means, and have not been read in
  silence.
- MIDI has been read over USB only; a DIN cable has not.
- Many controls and screens were checked in the simulator and over the console, not by hand on the unit.
- The manual and its pictures are new.
