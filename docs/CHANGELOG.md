# Changelog

## v0.1.0 (pre-release)

The first public release. It is a pre-release and needs more testing.

### What it does

- Four modes: BANDS (a 16-band channel vocoder), TALK (an LPC talkbox), TUNE (pitch correction to a key and scale) and ROBOT (the bands
  with a fast compressor).
- Sources: the line input, the microphone, USB audio, the radio, and samples on either side of the vocoder.
- An internal carrier synth of eight voices (SHAPE, SPREAD, SUB, TILT, NOISE), played from chord pads: twelve roots, triad, seventh, open
  and power rows, four voicings (CLOSE, OPEN, WIDE, SMOOTH), a KEYS mode and a bend row. The SHIFT row holds FREEZE, GATE, ARP, GLIDE,
  FORMANT, THRU, BEND ROW and PRESET.
- Four sample slots of 16 s, with up to 24 slices each, edited on the unit (trim, speed, direction, slices).
- A step sequencer: eight patterns (A to H) of 1 to 16 steps with NOTE, CARRIER, LEVEL and SLICE lanes, and a SONG of up to 16 rows
  with repeats.
- MIDI in: notes, pitch bend, mod wheel vibrato, program change (picks the pattern), notes from 36 that fire slices, MIDI learn and a
  clock to follow.
- Projects saved to the card as `project.o3a` under `Apps/o3_voc03er/`, with the sample slots as WAVs.

### What a unit has shown

Read on a unit during development (`docs/PLAN.md`, sections 4 to 4l):

- The render's CPU stays under its limit on the readings taken, with BANDS, eight carrier notes and four loops running (about 62 to 67 % of
  the block at the worst peak on the last readings), with no underrun and no shed in any of them. TALK at order 16 is inside the budget by
  its mean.
- A project round trip works: speed, direction, level and trim of a slot come back after a save and a load, and the other slots stay as
  they were. Saving the WAVs takes about 2 s a slot, and so does loading.
- MIDI over USB works.

### Needs more testing

- The sound is judged by ear on the unit, and that listening is still owed for most of it: the glides, the gate edges, the vibrato, the
  presets' levels, the carrier's tone, the formant steps and the clicks at the source switch. A spoken sentence has to be checked for how
  well it can be understood, and the microphone source has had little use.
- The radio's signal was not measured on a known station. Line and radio were reported as working by the maintainer, not by a reading.
- Some readings pass the CPU limit at the peak in the heaviest settings (BANDS with every carrier control at its extreme, TALK at its
  highest order). The maintainer accepted that for now.
- MIDI has been read over USB only; a DIN cable has not.
- Many controls and screens were checked in the simulator and over the console, not by hand on the unit.
- The manual and its pictures are new.
